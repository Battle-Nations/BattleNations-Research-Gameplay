# Overview
This file details all actions that are unique to missions that are edge cases compared to usual actions that can be taken. For example, in the intro battle, an airstrike destroys units after a few turns, which is different from normal battles where there aren't battle ending airstrikes midway through the battle. Another example would be special items that need to be displayed during missions that ask you to make stuff in shops. Normally only 4 items are shown, but when missions like those are active, more items are displayed.

Please format as follows:

Mission Name or when/where action occurs: Description of what happens
